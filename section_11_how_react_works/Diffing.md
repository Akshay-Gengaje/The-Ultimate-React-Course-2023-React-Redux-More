# How Diffing Works? 

"Differencing" or "diffing" is a crucial step in the process of updating the user interface efficiently, especially when using techniques like the Virtual DOM in libraries like React. Diffing involves comparing the new or updated Virtual DOM with the previous Virtual DOM to identify the differences, so that only these differences can be applied to the real Document Object Model (DOM). Here's how diffing works:

1. **Old Virtual DOM and New Virtual DOM**:
   - First, you have the old or previous Virtual DOM, representing the state of the user interface.
   - Next, you have the new or updated Virtual DOM, which represents the desired state of the UI after some change or update.

2. **Element Comparison**:
   - The diffing process starts at the root of both the old and new Virtual DOM trees.
   - Each element in the old Virtual DOM is compared to the corresponding element in the new Virtual DOM. This comparison is typically done using a unique key or identifier for each element.
   - There are three possibilities for each pair of elements:
     - The element is unchanged (i.e., the content and attributes are the same).
     - The element is updated (i.e., the content or attributes have changed).
     - The element is new (i.e., it doesn't exist in the old Virtual DOM).
     - The element is removed (i.e., it exists in the old Virtual DOM but not in the new one).

3. **Determination of Changes**:
   - The differences between the old and new Virtual DOMs are recorded. This involves marking elements as needing updates, removal, or addition in the real DOM.
   - Elements marked as needing updates have specific changes, such as modified content or attributes. These changes need to be applied to the real DOM.
   - Elements marked for removal are typically removed from the real DOM during the commit phase.
   - Elements marked for addition are added to the real DOM in the commit phase.

4. **Recursion and Depth-First Approach**:
   - The diffing process is recursive and employs a depth-first approach. It traverses the entire Virtual DOM tree to compare and identify differences in child elements.
   - Elements that are updated or new can also have children, so the diffing process continues within these elements.

5. **Efficiency and Optimization**:
   - Diffing algorithms are designed to be efficient and minimize unnecessary comparisons. Some algorithms employ heuristics or shortcuts to speed up the process.
   - React, for instance, uses a reconciliation algorithm and a diffing strategy that is optimized for minimizing the number of changes to be made in the real DOM.

6. **Completion**:
   - After the diffing process is completed, the set of changes that need to be made to the real DOM is determined.
   - These changes are then applied during the commit phase to update the actual DOM.

In summary, diffing is a critical step in the virtual-to-real DOM update process, where differences between the old and new Virtual DOMs are identified efficiently to determine the minimal set of changes needed to update the real DOM. This process is essential for optimizing the rendering of web applications and improving performance.
