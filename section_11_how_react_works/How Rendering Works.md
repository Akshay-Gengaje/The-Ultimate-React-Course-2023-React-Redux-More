Rendering in React is the process by which the user interface is constructed and updated based on the current state and data. React's rendering process is efficient and performs updates in a way that minimizes the manipulation of the actual DOM, thanks to its use of the Virtual DOM. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how rendering works in React:

1. **Component Hierarchy**:
   In a React application, you create a component hierarchy. At the top of this hierarchy is typically your root component, often referred to as the "App" component. The component hierarchy is defined in your application code.

2. **Initial Rendering**:
   When your application starts, React performs an initial rendering. It begins by creating instances of the root component and its child components, recursively. This process results in the creation of a Virtual DOM tree that mirrors the structure of your component hierarchy.

3. **Updating State or Props**:
   As your application runs, the state or props of components may change. When a component's state or props change, React schedules an update for that component.

4. **Reconciliation**:
   React compares the new Virtual DOM tree, representing the updated state of the application, to the previous Virtual DOM tree. This process is known as reconciliation. It involves a "diffing" algorithm that identifies the differences between the two trees. React tries to minimize the number of changes needed to transform the previous Virtual DOM into the new one.

5. **Reactive Updates**:
   After identifying the differences between the new and previous Virtual DOM trees, React calculates the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM. This is a key aspect of React's efficiency; it only makes necessary changes to the real DOM. React updates only the parts of the UI that have changed.

6. **Render Function**:
   React invokes the `render` function of the affected components, which returns a description of the UI for that component based on its new state or props. This description is in the form of Virtual DOM elements, which are JavaScript objects representing the structure of the UI.

7. **Virtual DOM Updates**:
   The Virtual DOM elements created in the `render` functions are compared to the previous Virtual DOM to determine what should be updated in the real DOM. React then applies these updates to the actual DOM, making it reflect the new state and props of the components.

8. **Lifecycle Methods**:
   During the rendering process, React also calls various lifecycle methods such as `componentDidUpdate`, allowing you to perform additional tasks or side effects after the component has been updated.

9. **Repeat the Process**:
   This process repeats whenever state or props change in the application. React continuously keeps track of changes and efficiently updates the UI as needed.

By using this process, React ensures that the user interface remains consistent with the underlying data and state changes. It optimizes rendering by minimizing DOM manipulations, making it an efficient choice for building dynamic and responsive web applications.
