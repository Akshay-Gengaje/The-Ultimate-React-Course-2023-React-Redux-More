# What is Reconciliation and why do we need it?

Reconciliation, in the context of web development and user interfaces, refers to the process of updating the real Document Object Model (DOM) to reflect changes made in the Virtual DOM. It is an essential step in the Virtual DOM's workflow, which is used by libraries and frameworks like React to efficiently update web pages while minimizing performance overhead.

Here's why reconciliation is necessary and how it works:

**Why Reconciliation is Needed**:

1. **Efficiency**: When working with the Virtual DOM, changes to the UI are first made in a virtual representation of the DOM. This virtual DOM is compared to the previous version to determine the differences, which are the updates needed in the real DOM. Reconciliation ensures that only the necessary changes are applied to the real DOM, making the process more efficient.

2. **Performance**: Manipulating the real DOM directly can be slow and resource-intensive, especially when dealing with complex UIs. Reconciliation optimizes this process by reducing the number of direct changes to the real DOM, resulting in improved performance.

**How Reconciliation Works**:

1. **Diffing**: After changes are made to the virtual DOM, a "diffing" process is carried out to compare the new virtual DOM with the previous one. This comparison identifies which parts of the virtual DOM have changed.

2. **Minimal Updates**: Once the differences are identified, the next step is to calculate the minimal set of updates needed to bring the real DOM in line with the new virtual DOM. This process determines what nodes in the real DOM need to be created, updated, or removed.

3. **Updating the Real DOM**: With the minimal update plan in place, the real DOM is updated accordingly. This update process is typically more efficient and faster than directly making changes to the entire DOM tree.

The key benefits of reconciliation are:

- **Improved Performance**: By only applying the necessary changes to the real DOM, the web page's performance is enhanced, reducing rendering time and minimizing browser work.

- **Efficient Updates**: Reconciliation ensures that only the affected parts of the UI are updated, rather than updating the entire DOM, which can be resource-intensive.

- **Consistency**: It helps maintain a consistent and synchronized view between the virtual DOM and the real DOM, ensuring that the UI accurately reflects the application's state.

Reconciliation is a critical part of the Virtual DOM concept, which is widely used in modern web development to create responsive and efficient user interfaces in applications, particularly in libraries and frameworks like React.
