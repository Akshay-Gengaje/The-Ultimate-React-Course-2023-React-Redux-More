Custom hooks in React are reusable functions that encapsulate logic related to state management, side effects, or any other functionality you want to share across multiple components. They are a way to extract and share component logic without duplicating code, making your React codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.

Custom hooks follow the naming convention of starting with "use" to indicate that they are hooks. These hooks can use built-in hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`, as well as other custom hooks, making them versatile for various use cases.

Here's how you can create and use a custom hook:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

// Custom hook to fetch data and manage loading and error states
function useDataFetching(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }

    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}

// Using the custom hook in a component
function MyComponent() {
  const { data, loading, error } = useDataFetching(
    "https://api.example.com/data"
  );

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

When to use custom hooks:

1. **Reusing Logic**: Use custom hooks when you find yourself duplicating the same logic in multiple components. Extracting the logic into a custom hook allows you to maintain it in one place.

2. **Abstraction**: Custom hooks can abstract complex logic or interactions, making your component code cleaner and more focused on the component's core functionality.

3. **Sharing State Logic**: If you need to manage shared state between components, you can create a custom hook to encapsulate that state management and share it easily across multiple components.

4. **Side Effects**: When multiple components have similar side effects, like data fetching, authentication, or local storage interactions, you can create a custom hook to handle these side effects consistently.

5. **Testing**: Custom hooks make it easier to test specific functionality independently. You can test the custom hook's behavior in isolation, making your tests more focused and maintainable.

6. **Organization**: Custom hooks improve code organization by separating concerns. This separation makes it easier to understand and maintain your codebase, as logic is grouped into reusable units.

Custom hooks are a powerful way to enhance code reusability, readability, and maintainability in your React applications. They promote the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle and allow you to share and manage logic efficiently across your components.Custom hooks in React are reusable functions that encapsulate logic related to state management, side effects, or any other functionality you want to share across multiple components.
