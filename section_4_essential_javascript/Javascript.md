## Object and Array Destructuring in JavaScript ðŸš€

Destructuring is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract values from arrays and objects and assign them to variables in a more concise and readable way. They make working with complex data structures more straightforward.

## Object Destructuring

Object destructuring is used to extract values from objects by matching the variable names with the object's property names.

### Syntax:

```javascript
const { property1, property2, ...rest } = myObject;
```

### Example:

[Object Destructuring](./objectDestructuring.js)
