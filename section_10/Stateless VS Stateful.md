In the context of web development, particularly in frameworks like React, components are a fundamental concept. Stateless components, stateful components, and structured components refer to different types of components with varying roles and characteristics:

1. **Stateless Components**:
   - Also known as functional components in React.
   - They are pure functions that accept props (input data) and return JSX (rendered UI).
   - Stateless components do not have internal state. They rely solely on the data passed to them via props.
   - They are generally used for presentational purposes and are easy to test and reason about since they have no internal state.

Example of a stateless/functional component in React:

```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
}
```

2. **Stateful Components**:
   - Also known as class components in React (prior to React 16.8) or as components with state in modern React using hooks.
   - Stateful components can manage and maintain their own internal state using the `setState` method (in class components) or `useState` hook (in functional components).
   - They are used when a component needs to manage and update its data over time, for example, in response to user interactions or asynchronous events.
   - Stateful components are typically responsible for the logic and behavior of a component.

Example of a stateful class component in React:

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  increment() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Count: {this.state.count}
        <button onClick={() => this.increment()}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Example of a stateful functional component in React using hooks:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

3. **Structured Components** (Custom Term?):
   - This term is not commonly used in web development contexts, and its meaning can vary depending on the context in which it's used.
   - Structured components might refer to components that are well-organized and follow best practices in terms of component structure, separation of concerns, and code organization.
   - It could also refer to a custom architectural approach or pattern specific to a particular project or framework.

In summary, stateless components are simple and functional components that don't have internal state, stateful components manage their own state, and the term "structured components" is not a widely recognized concept in web development but could refer to well-organized and properly designed components.
