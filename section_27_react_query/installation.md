### React Query v4 Installation and Fundamentals

#### 1. 📦 **Install React Query v4**

- Use npm or yarn to install React Query v4 in your project:

  ```bash
    npm install @tanstack/react-query
    # or
    yarn add @tanstack/react-query
  ```

#### 2. ⚙️ **Set Up React Query in Your App**

- Import `QueryClient` and `QueryClientProvider` in your main app file (e.g., `index.js` or `App.js`).

  ```javascript
  import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "react-query/next";
  ```

- Create an instance of `QueryClient` and wrap your app with `QueryClientProvider`.

  ```javascript
  const queryClient = new QueryClient();

  ReactDOM.render(
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
  );
  ```

#### 3. 🚀 **Basic Data Fetching**

- Use the `useQuery` hook to fetch data in a component.

  ```javascript
  import { useQuery } from "react-query/next";

  const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery("myData", fetchDataFunction);
  ```

- `myData` is a unique query key, and `fetchDataFunction` is the function responsible for fetching data.

#### 4. 🔄 **Caching Data**

- React Query automatically caches fetched data.
- Subsequent component renders with the same query key (`myData` in this case) will use the cached data, minimizing unnecessary API calls.

#### 5. ⚡ **Automatic Refetching**

- React Query can automatically refetch data under certain conditions, ensuring data stays up-to-date.
- Configure refetching with options like `refetchInterval` or `refetchOnWindowFocus`.

#### 6. 🛠️ **Data Mutation**

- Use the `useMutation` hook for updating or mutating data.

  ```javascript
  import { useMutation } from "react-query/next";

  const mutation = useMutation(updateDataFunction);
  ```

#### 7. 📡 **Offline Support**

- Leverage React Query's built-in features to handle offline scenarios seamlessly.
- Components can continue using cached data even when the app is offline.

#### 8. 🌐 **Additional Configuration**

- Explore and customize React Query further with additional configurations like global error handling, custom hooks, and more.

#### 9. 📖 **Documentation Reference**

- Refer to the [official React Query documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/v4) for in-depth explanations, examples, and advanced usage.

By following these steps, you'll have React Query v4 integrated into your React application, enabling efficient data fetching, caching, and state management.
