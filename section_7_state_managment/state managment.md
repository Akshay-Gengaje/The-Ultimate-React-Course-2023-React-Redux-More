# State vs Props

In React, both state and props are used to manage and pass data within a component and between components, but they have different purposes and characteristics. Here's a tabular comparison of state and props in React:

| Feature               | State                                                                                             | Props                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ownership**         | Belongs to the component where it is declared.                                                    | Passed to a component from its parent component.                                                                                                        |
| **Mutability**        | Can be changed using `setState()` method, making it mutable.                                      | Immutable and cannot be modified within the component.                                                                                                  |
| **Initialization**    | Typically initialized in the component's constructor using `this.state`.                          | Passed down from a parent component when the child component is created.                                                                                |
| **Source of Truth**   | Represents the internal data and state of a component.                                            | Represents data that is received from a parent component or external source.                                                                            |
| **Scope**             | Local to the component where it is defined.                                                       | Can be accessed by child components through their props.                                                                                                |
| **Purpose**           | Used to store and manage dynamic data that can change over time and trigger component re-renders. | Used to pass data from parent components to child components, allowing communication between them.                                                      |
| **Update Triggers**   | Changes to state trigger a component re-render.                                                   | Changes to props do not trigger a re-render in the child component. However, they can be used to conditionally render content or update internal state. |
| **Typical Usage**     | For managing component-specific data and user interactions within a component.                    | For passing data, configuration, and callbacks to child components.                                                                                     |
| **Examples**          | `js this.state = { count: 0 };`                                                                   | `js <ChildComponent data={someData} />`                                                                                                                 |
| **Access**            | Accessed using `this.state.someValue`.                                                            | Accessed using `this.props.someValue`.                                                                                                                  |
| **Update Mechanism**  | Use `this.setState()` to update state and trigger re-renders.                                     | Parent component passes updated props to child components.                                                                                              |
| **Lifecycle Methods** | Often used with `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, etc., to handle state changes.         | Often used with `componentWillReceiveProps`, `render`, etc., to work with props.                                                                        |
