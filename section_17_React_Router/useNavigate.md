`useNavigate` is a hook provided by the React Router library, which is used for programmatic navigation in a React application. It allows you to programmatically change the URL and navigate to different routes in your single-page web application.

Here's how to use `useNavigate`:

1. **Installation**: First, make sure you have React Router installed in your project. You can install it with npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```

2. **Usage**:

   ```jsx
   import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

   function MyComponent() {
     const navigate = useNavigate();

     const handleButtonClick = () => {
       // Use navigate to change the route programmatically.
       navigate("/new-route");
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <h1>My Component</h1>
         <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Go to New Route</button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

In this example, when the button is clicked, the `handleButtonClick` function uses the `navigate` function returned by `useNavigate` to change the route to '/new-route'. This action will trigger a navigation to the specified route, updating the URL and rendering the corresponding component associated with that route.

`useNavigate` is a powerful tool for handling client-side navigation within your React application. It's particularly useful for scenarios like form submissions, user interactions, or other events that require you to change the route without a full page reload.
