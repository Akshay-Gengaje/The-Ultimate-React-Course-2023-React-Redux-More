`useParams` is a hook provided by the React Router library, which is commonly used for building single-page web applications with dynamic routing. This hook allows you to access route parameters from the current URL, making it easier to create dynamic and data-driven components.

When to use `useParams`:

1. Dynamic Routing: When you want to create routes that include dynamic segments, such as user profiles, product pages, or any route where the URL contains variable data.

2. Accessing Route Parameters: To extract and use the parameters or values from the URL in your React components.

3. Building Data-Driven UI: When you want to display different content or fetch data based on the parameters in the URL.

Here's an example of how to use `useParams` in a React component:

```jsx
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function UserProfile() {
  const { username } = useParams();

  // Now, 'username' contains the value of the "username" parameter from the URL.
  // You can use it to fetch user-specific data, render content, or perform other actions.

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>User Profile: {username}</h2>
      {/* Render user-specific content here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, if your route is defined like this:

```jsx
<Route path="/user/:username">
  <UserProfile />
</Route>
```

And the URL is something like "/user/johndoe," `useParams` will provide you with the value "johndoe" for the `username` parameter. You can then use this value to customize your UI or fetch data specific to the user.

`useParams` is a valuable tool for creating dynamic and data-driven React applications with client-side routing using React Router.
